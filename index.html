<h1>Hello There!</h1>
<h2>Who Am I ?</h2>
<p>I'm an engineering student passionate about programming. at the moment trying to learn python. Primarly : numpy, pandas and matplotlib <br />I will be documenting what I learn here so understanding HTML, CSS and Javascript are also an objective   </p>
<h2>First project : OOP tree</h2>
<p>I often get confused trying to diffrenciate between attributes, classes, methods, objects ,instances, ... So I though that making a tree-like diagram will help with remembering all the vocabulary  and how it works</p>
